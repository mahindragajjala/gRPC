gRPC solves many problems traditional 
REST or HTTP APIs face, 
especially in high-performance, scalable distributed systems.


Advantages of the gRPC
           Feature                         Description                                                                                
            High Performance          Uses HTTP/2 for multiplexing, binary framing (not text), and faster transmission.      
            Efficient Serialization   Uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)—much faster and smaller than JSON or XML.             
            Strongly Typed Contracts  Protobuf defines strict data types, minimizing runtime errors and improving code quality.  
            Code Generation           Automatically generates client/server code in multiple languages (Go, Java, Python, etc.). 
            Streaming Support         Full-duplex streaming with `server-streaming`, `client-streaming`, and `bi-directional`.   
            Cross-language Support    Works across multiple languages and platforms, great for polyglot systems.                 
            Built-in Authentication   Supports TLS, JWT, OAuth2, and more out of the box.                                        
            Load Balancing & Timeout  Advanced features like retries, deadlines, timeout, and load balancing are supported.      
            Smaller Payloads          Protobuf messages are compact and efficient in memory and bandwidth usage.                 
            Ideal for Microservices   Lightweight, scalable, and optimized for internal service communication in microservices.  
          
          
           Use Case                            Why gRPC Works Well                                                 
           Microservices Architecture          Efficient communication between internal services.                  
           Real-time Communication Systems     Full-duplex streaming is perfect for chats, gaming, telemetry, etc. 
           IoT and Mobile Devices              Low-bandwidth and resource-efficient communication with Protobuf.   
           Multi-language Systems              Generate clients in Python, Go, Java, etc., from one `.proto` file. 
           Internal APIs for High Performance  Better performance than REST for backend-to-backend communication.  


When NOT to Use gRPC
 Scenario                          Reason                                                                       
 Public Web APIs                   Browsers don't natively support HTTP/2/gRPC easily—REST/JSON is better here. 
 Human-readable API Communication  Protobuf is not human-readable like JSON; harder for debugging manually.     
 Simple CRUD over HTTP             Overkill if you're just doing basic HTTP CRUD operations.
