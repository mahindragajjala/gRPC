Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a method for serializing structured data, 
developed by Google. - from structure data to raw data 
They provide a 
              language-neutral, 
              platform-neutral, and 
              extensible mechanism 
              for efficiently serializing structured data. 

Here are the key aspects of Protocol Buffers:
Schema Definition:
Data structures in Protocol Buffers are defined in a schema file 
(.proto file) using a simple language-independent interface 
definition language (IDL).

This schema defines the structure and data types of the 
information being serialized.
type User struct {
    ID       int64
    Name     string
    Email    string
    IsActive bool
}
syntax = "proto3";

package userpb;

message User {
    int64 id = 1;
    string name = 2;
    string email = 3;
    bool is_active = 4;
}




Serialization Format:
Protocol Buffers serialize data into a binary format.
This binary format is compact, efficient for transmission over networks, 
and faster to serialize 
and deserialize compared to text-based formats like XML or JSON.



Language Support:
Protocol Buffers are supported across multiple programming languages, 
including C++, Java, Python, Go, and many others.

Google provides compiler tools (protobuf compiler) that generate data 
access classes and serialization/deserialization code in these languages 
based on the .proto schema file.



Backward and Forward Compatibility:
Protocol Buffers support backward and forward compatibility. 

New fields can be added to the schema without breaking existing 
clients or servers that may still be using older versions of the schema.

This makes it easier to evolve data formats over time in large-scale systems.
