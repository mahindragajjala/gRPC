In gRPC, Interceptors are middleware hooks that intercept gRPC calls before and/or 
after they are handled by the actual service methods.

They are similar to HTTP middleware in frameworks like Gin or Express.

 Purpose                              Explanation                                        
 🔐 Authentication/Authorization  Check tokens or credentials before allowing access 
 🪵 Logging                       Log every incoming and outgoing message            
 📊 Metrics Collection            Track number of messages, time taken, etc.         
 🧪 Testing/Mocking               Modify behavior or inject test responses           
 🔁 Message Validation/Mutation   Modify or validate incoming/outgoing messages      
 ⏱ Timeout/Rate-Limiting          Control resource usage and performance             


Without Interceptors?
You’d have to add manual logging, validation, auth checks, etc. 
in every service method, leading to:
                                    Duplicate logic
                                    Error-prone code
                                    Poor separation of concerns
