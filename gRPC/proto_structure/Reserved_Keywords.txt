Reserved Keywords (optional)

  The reserved keyword is optional but very important 
  for ensuring forward and backward 
  compatibility of your .proto files, especially in 
  large or evolving systems.



ðŸ”¹ What is the reserved keyword?
                    - The reserved keyword is used to prevent reuse of:
                                    - Field numbers
                                    - Field names
                    - Once a field is removed or renamed in a 
                          .proto message, using reserved ensures that:
                    - No one reuses that field number or field name for another purpose.
                    - It prevents accidental deserialization bugs in future versions.
                    
                    Reserve Field Numbers:
                                          message User {
                                            reserved 2, 4 to 6;
                                          }
                    Reserve Field Names
                                          message User {
                                            reserved "username", "password";
                                          }
                    Both Together
                                  message User {
                                    reserved 2, 4 to 6;
                                    reserved "username", "password";
                                  }
