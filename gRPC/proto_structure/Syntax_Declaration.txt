In a gRPC .proto file, the syntax declaration is used to specify the 
version of Protocol Buffers being used for the definition. 

This is a required line and comes at the very top of your .proto file.


syntax = "proto3";


Purpose of the syntax declaration:
 Aspect             Explanation                                                                                                               
 Versioning     Tells the `protoc` compiler whether to use proto2 or proto3 features.                                             
 Parsing Rules  Determines how the `.proto` file is parsed and what features are available (e.g., optional fields, default values, etc.). 
 Compatibility  Helps ensure backward and forward compatibility between clients and servers using different ProtoBuf versions.            




gRPC uses Protocol Buffers as the IDL (Interface Definition Language) and serialization mechanism. So:

The syntax defines how messages and services are written.
The proto3 version is the default for gRPC because it has:
              Simpler syntax (no required fields).
              Defaults for all fields (zero values).
              More efficient serialization.
              Better support in modern languages (Go, Python, etc.).
