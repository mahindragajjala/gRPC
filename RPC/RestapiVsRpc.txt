‚úÖ When to Use REST API (HTTP/REST):
üî∑ REST is Best For:
              Public APIs (e.g., Twitter, GitHub, etc.)
              Microservices that need standardization
              Stateless communication
              Web-friendly systems (e.g., browser-based apps)
              Interoperability (works well across languages and platforms)

üîß REST Advantages:
                  Human-readable (URLs, JSON)
                  Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
                  Easier to debug
                  Browser-accessible
                  Caching supported (using HTTP caching)
                  Works seamlessly with tools like Postman, Swagger

‚ùå REST Limitations:
                    Verbose (more data over the wire)
                    Slower than binary protocols
                    Less efficient for internal services or real-time comms

‚úÖ When to Use RPC (e.g., gRPC, Thrift, JSON-RPC):
üî∑ RPC is Best For:
                  Internal microservices communication
                  High-performance backend systems
                  Real-time applications (e.g., video, gaming, chat)
                  Strongly typed APIs
                  Smaller payloads, lower latency

üîß RPC Advantages:
                  Fast (uses binary formats like Protocol Buffers)
                  Compact (low bandwidth usage)
                  Strong typing (IDL support)
                  Built-in code generation (client and server)
                  Bi-directional streaming (in gRPC)

‚ùå RPC Limitations:
                    Not human-readable (e.g., Protobuf)
                    Harder to test/debug without tooling
                    Not easily accessible via browsers
                    Steeper learning curve for setup (especially gRPC)
