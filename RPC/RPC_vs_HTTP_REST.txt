RPC vs HTTP/REST

              Both RPC and HTTP/REST are used for communication between different systems over a network,
              but they differ in paradigm, structure, data format, performance, and flexibility.


                                        Fundamental Concept
 Feature      RPC (Remote Procedure Call)                                HTTP/REST (Representational State Transfer)                
 Core Idea    Call a method/function on a remote server like it's local  Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to manipulate resources 
 Abstraction  Function/Procedure-based                                   Resource-based (everything is a resource)                  





                                        Architecture Style
 Category       RPC                                           RESTful HTTP                            
 Style          Action/operation-centric (e.g., `getUser()`)  Resource-centric (e.g., `GET /users/1`) 
 Communication  Client sends method name + parameters         Client sends HTTP verbs + URLs          
 Protocol       Can be over HTTP, TCP, or other protocols     Strictly over HTTP                      




                                              Verb Usage
 Aspect        RPC                                                       REST                                                     
 Verbs         You define functions like `CreateUser()`, `DeleteFile()`  Uses standard HTTP verbs: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` 
 Standardized  No (custom verbs/methods)                                 Yes (uniform interface constraints)                      




                                            Performance
 Feature       RPC                                               HTTP/REST                           
 Payload Size  Typically smaller (Protobuf is compact)           Larger due to JSON/XML overhead     
 Speed         Faster — lower serialization time                 Slower — more parsing/serialization 
 Suitable For  Internal microservices, high-performance systems  Public APIs, open-web communication 




                                      Discoverability and Documentation
 Aspect            RPC                                       REST                                  
 URL Discoverable  ❌ (Needs documentation or IDL)            ✅ (Self-descriptive URLs)             
 Tooling           gRPC uses `.proto` files for definitions  REST often uses Swagger/OpenAPI specs 



                                    Language Support
 Category          RPC                                                   REST                                          
 Language Binding  Requires code generation (`.proto` → Go, Java, etc.)  Just use HTTP libraries, no code-gen required 
 Interoperability  Less flexible without tooling                         Easy for any language with HTTP/JSON support  



                 Use Cases
 Use Case                              Preferred Style  
 Internal microservices (low-latency)  RPC (e.g., gRPC) 
 Public APIs (open to web clients)     REST             
 High-performance streaming            gRPC (RPC)       
 Simple CRUD APIs for mobile/web       REST
