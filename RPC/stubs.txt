What is a Stub in RPC?
- A stub is a proxy or placeholder that represents a remote 
  function locally.
- It hides the complexity of network communication and makes it look 
  like you are calling a regular local function â€” even though it 
  actually sends the request over the network.
-      Stub Type  Where It Runs       Role                                                
     Client Stub  On the client side  Packs the request, sends it to the server           
     Server Stub  On the server side  Unpacks the request, calls the actual server method 





ðŸ”¸ How it Works (Step-by-Step)
          Example:
          You want to call a remote function: Add(a, b).
          
          Client Code Calls Add(5, 3)
          â†’ Actually calls the Client Stub.
          
          Client Stub
          â†’ Marshals (a=5, b=3) into a network request.
          â†’ Sends it to the server over TCP/HTTP.
          
          Server Stub
          â†’ Receives the network request.
          â†’ Unmarshals the parameters.
          â†’ Calls the real Add() function on the server.
          
          Server Stub Gets Result
          â†’ Marshals the return value (e.g., 8).
          â†’ Sends it back to the client.
          
          Client Stub Receives Result
          â†’ Unmarshals it and returns it as if it was a local result.







 Real-World Analogy
    Imagine you use a remote control (client stub) to turn on a TV 
    (actual function).
    
    You donâ€™t touch the TV directly.
    The remote (stub) sends a signal (network request).
    The TV (server) processes it and responds (changes state).
    You see the result (TV turns on), without knowing what happens inside.





ðŸ”¹ Stub in Code Generation (e.g., gRPC)
        In gRPC, when you define a service in a .proto file, 
        the tool generates:
        Client Stub Code: Functions that look like local methods 
                          (Add, Login, etc.)
        Server Stub Code: Functions you fill in with the actual logic
        So you just use or implement the stubs 
        â€” no need to write network code manually.
