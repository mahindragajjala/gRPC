Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, 
extensible mechanism for serializing structured data 
â€” developed by Google.

It is widely used for communication between microservices and for 
storing data, especially with gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call).

Why Use Protocol Buffers?
 Feature               Description                                              
 Efficient         Much smaller and faster than JSON or XML                 
 Cross-language    Works with many languages: Go, Java, Python, C++, etc.   
 Version tolerant  You can add/remove fields without breaking existing code 
 Binary format     Compact binary representation (not human-readable)       
 Strongly typed    Type-safe and schema-driven                              


Basic Terminology
                .proto file â€” defines the schema (structure) of your data.
                message â€” equivalent to a class or struct in your code
                service â€” used in gRPC to define RPC methods.


        syntax = "proto3";
        
        package user;
        
        message User {
          int32 id = 1;
          string name = 2;
          string email = 3;
        }



REAL TIME EXAMPLE
Problem Without Protobuf
        Suppose the client (mobile app) sends an order to the server using JSON:
                    {
                      "order_id": 12345,
                      "user_id": 987,
                      "items": [
                        {"item_id": 1, "name": "Pizza", "quantity": 2},
                        {"item_id": 2, "name": "Coke", "quantity": 1}
                      ],
                      "delivery_address": "123 Main Street"
                    }
        Drawbacks:
                  Large size â€” JSON carries field names with every message.
                  Slower parsing â€” especially on mobile/IoT devices.
                  No strict typing â€” error-prone when fields are missing or wrong types.
        

1.Solution With Protocol Buffers
                        Define Schema in .proto File
                                                    syntax = "proto3";
                                                    
                                                    package fooddelivery;
                                                    
                                                    message OrderItem {
                                                      int32 item_id = 1;
                                                      string name = 2;
                                                      int32 quantity = 3;
                                                    }
                                                    
                                                    message Order {
                                                      int32 order_id = 1;
                                                      int32 user_id = 2;
                                                      repeated OrderItem items = 3;
                                                      string delivery_address = 4;
                                                    }

2. ðŸ§± Server and Client Use Same Compiled Schema
      Protobuf will generate Go, Python, Java, etc. code from this .proto file.
      protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. order.proto



3.Communication flow 
  [Mobile App] ---(Protobuf Message)---> [Backend Server]
  
  Compact Binary:
  0001 1001 0100 0010 1100 1010 ...
