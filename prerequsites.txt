Great questions! Letâ€™s break this into four parts:



 âœ… 1. When to use TCP vs HTTP

 Feature          TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)                         HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)           
      
 Type         Lowlevel transport protocol                                Highlevel application protocol built on TCP 
 Use Cases    Realtime apps (gaming, chat, streaming), custom protocols  Web apps, APIs, browserserver communication 
 Reliability  Connectionoriented, reliable                               Reliable (built on TCP), but textbased      
 Data Format  Raw bytes                                                   Structured (text/json/html/xml)              
 Flexibility  Fully customizable protocol over TCP                        Fixed format (headers, body)                 
 Latency      Lower latency                                               Higher than raw TCP due to HTTP headers      



 ðŸ§  Use TCP When:

* Youâ€™re building your own protocol (e.g., multiplayer game server)
* You need lower latency and fine control over packet handling
* Youâ€™re using binary or streaming data (VoIP, video, etc.)

 ðŸ§  Use HTTP When:

* You need interoperability across clients
* You want ease of debugging and browser support
* You're building web services or REST APIs



 âœ… 2. Where does gRPC fit in?

 gRPC   Uses HTTP/2 as transport + Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient binary encoding 
    
 Great for: microservices, realtime APIs, clientserver apps                                                                                       
 Provides: streaming, multiplexing, binary data, type safety                                                                                        

So gRPC is like:
Custom protocol (Protobuf) + over HTTP/2 + with streaming
It gives you the performance of TCP and easeofuse like HTTP.



 âœ… 3. How to Study TCP, HTTP, and gRPC (Call Flow Approach)

Hereâ€™s the call flow and learning order you should follow:

 ðŸ“˜ Phase 1: Networking Fundamentals (Layered understanding)

 Topics 
  

* OSI & TCP/IP model
* IP, Ports, Sockets
* DNS, NAT, Firewalls

ðŸ‘‰ Prerequisites:

* Basic Computer Networking
* IP addressing and ports
* Ping, traceroute, netstat, telnet tools



 ðŸ“˜ Phase 2: TCP Deep Dive

 Study Topics 
  

* TCP Handshake (SYN, ACK, FIN)
* Reliable transmission, windowing
* TCP packet structure
* Tools: `netcat`, `tcpdump`, `wireshark`

ðŸ‘‰ Practice:

* Write a basic TCP server and client in Go
* Understand connection, sending/receiving bytes



 ðŸ“˜ Phase 3: HTTP Deep Dive

 Study Topics 
  

* HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
* Headers, Cookies, Sessions
* REST API concepts

ðŸ‘‰ Practice:

* Create a small REST API in Go using `net/http`
* Use `curl` and `Postman` to test



 ðŸ“˜ Phase 4: gRPC in Go

 Study Topics 
  

* Protobuf syntax and code generation
* gRPC server and client in Go
* Unary vs Streaming RPCs
* Deadlines, cancellation, metadata
* Authentication (TLS)

ðŸ‘‰ Practice:

* Create a `UserService` with gRPC and test with CLI client
* Add streaming and error handling

 ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites Before Starting TCP, HTTP, gRPC

 âœ… Tools & Skills

* Go programming (functions, net/http, goroutines)
* Commandline skills (Linux/macOS terminal or PowerShell)
* Install tools: `protoc`, `curl`, `Postman`, `netcat`, `tcpdump`
